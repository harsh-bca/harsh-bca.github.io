## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Harsh** — a data analyst passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I specialize in Python, SQL, Power BI, and automation. I'm currently building data-driven projects and sharing my journey through my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/harsh._diaries).

## 💥 Why Should You Hire Me?

Because I’m not your average “I’m passionate about data” kind of guy. I actually do stuff. Here's why I’m worth your attention:

- 🔧 I’ve built real projects (not just tutorial copies) using Python, SQL, and Power BI — and they work.
- 📊 I don’t just clean data; I make it talk. Whether it’s youth trends or Google Analytics, I find the story behind the chaos.
- 💡 I think logically, act creatively, and communicate clearly.
- 🎤 From managing big events to handling deadlines solo — I know how to **show up and deliver**.
- ⚡ I’m still learning — but learning fast. I don’t fake it. I build it.

> Not here to fit in — here to **add something different** to your team.

If that’s the vibe you're hiring for, let’s talk. 👇
